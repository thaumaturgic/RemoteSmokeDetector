# RemoteSmokeDetector
My neighbor below me smokes. Alot. By the time I smell it, its too late and my apartment stinks of smoke. I want to have a sensor on my balcony that detects when he lights up so I can close my balcony door and keep the smoke out of my apartment.

I had a few goals in mind when starting on this project:
-Learn what the Arduino platform was capable of. 
-Get more familiar with bluetooth and other wireless technologies. 
-Learn more about powering embedded systems with batteries and techniques to measure, manage and reduce current usage.
-Learn how to use Git and Github to manage my projects better. There isnt much code to commit but I figured this would be good practice with trying out different Git clients and the Git workflow. 
-Last but not least, to actually build something useful that would keep my neighbor below me from filling my apartment with smoke.
